# Wtf is this?

An old ip booter source i made back somewhere in 2021 that i found on an old drive.
I have not checked if it works properly, this is up to you if you want to use it.
Feel free to do whatever you want with it. I don't care. I will not provide support for this source

# Vulnurabilities

There's a big chance vulns have opened up on this source as it hasn't been updated to 2 years.

# Use at your own risk

It's obviously not legal so use your fucking brains while using this.

# Unlogical methods

The code is a bit weird is i wasn't that good with js yet. But it got the job done perfectly
